== Using ckman as a Python library
In addition to using ckman as a standalone command line application, you can
also use this project as a Python library for scripting purposes.

=== Setup
You will need to have Python >= 3.7, and have `yubikey-manager` installed and
added to your PYTHON_PATH. You can verify that this is set up correctly by
running the following command from a Terminal:

    $ python -c "import ckman"

If the above runs without error (no output at all), then you should be all set.


=== Listing connected YubiKeys
The first step you'll likely want to do is to list currently connected
YubiKeys, and get some information about them. This is what the
`list_all_devices` function is for. It detects and connects to each attached
YubiKey, reading some information about it. It returns a list of tuples
consisting of a YubiKeyDevice and a corresponding DeviceInfo. The DeviceInfo
can tell you what kind of YubiKey it is, what capabilities it has, its serial
number, etc. The YubiKeyDevice will let you open a Connection to it, which will
let you interact with one of the available Applications.

[NOTE]
====
`list_all_devices` connects to each detected YubiKey to read out some
information. This will interrupt any already-established connections! See
`scan_devices` for a an alternative which does not interrupt existing
connections.
====

==== Example
[source,py]
----
from ckman.device import list_all_devices
from canokit.core.smartcard import SmartCardConnection

for device, info in list_all_devices():
    if info.version >= (5, 0, 0):  # The info object provides details about the YubiKey
        print(f"Found YubiKey with serial number: {info.serial}")
----


=== Connecting to a YubiKey
To actually do anything with a YubiKey you'll need to create a Connection and
establish a session with a YubiKey Application. Depending on which Application
you intend to access, you'll need to establish a specific type of Connection.
Once you have a reference to a YubiKeyDevice you can call the `open_connection`
method on it to open a Connection of a specific type. There are three different
types of Connections, used for different Applications. These are
`SmartCardConnection`, `OtpConnection` and `FidoConnection`.  Once you are done
using a Connection, you should close it. This can be done explicitly by calling
`connection.close()`, or by using a `with` block.

==== Example
[source,py]
----
from ckman.device import list_all_devices
from canokit.core.smartcard import SmartCardConnection
from canokit.piv import PivSession

# Select a connected YubiKeyDevice
dev, info = list_all_devices()[0]

# Connect to a YubiKey over a SmartCardConnection, which is needed for PIV.
with dev.open_connection(SmartCardConnection) as connection:
    # The connection will be automatically closed after this block

    piv = PivSession(connection)
    attempts = piv.get_pin_attempts()
    print(f"You have {attempts} PIN attempts left.")
----


=== Detecting YubiKey insertion
Sometimes you'll want to do something when a YubiKey is inserted. You can use
the `scan_devices` function to poll for changes to the connected YubiKeys,
without interrupting any ongoing connections. It returns a dict of PIDs
(Product Identifiers) mapped to the number of connected devices for each PID,
as well as a `state` parameter which will change if the configuration of
connected YubiKeys changes.

==== Example
[source,py]
----
from ckman.device import list_all_devices, scan_devices
from canokit.core.smartcard import SmartCardConnection
from time import sleep

handled_serials = set()  # Keep track of YubiKeys we've already handled.
state = None

while True:  # Run this until we stop the script with Ctrl+C
    pids, new_state = scan_devices()
    if new_state != state:
        state = new_state  # State has changed
        for device, info in list_all_devices():
            if info.serial not in handled_serials:  # Unhandled YubiKey
                print(f"Programming YubiKey with serial: {info.serial}")
                ...  # Do something with the device here.
                handled_serials.add(info.serial)
    else:
        sleep(1.0)  # No change, sleep for 1 second.
